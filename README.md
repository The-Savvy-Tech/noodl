# Noodl

[Noodl](https://noodl.net) is a low-code platform where designers and developers build custom applications and experiences. Designed as a visual programming environment, it aims to expedite your development process. It promotes the swift and efficient creation of applications, requiring minimal coding knowledge.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install all dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the Noodl Editor and build a production version of the cloud and react runtime (useful when running Noodl from source but want to deploy to production)
$ npm start

# Start the Noodl Editor and watch the filesystem for changes to the runtimes. Development versions of the runtimes, not meant for production (mostly due to source maps and file size)
# This is ideal for a quick workflow when doing changes on the runtimes.
$ npm run dev

# Start Noodl Editor test runner
$ npm run test:editor
```
